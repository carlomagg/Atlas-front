## üîß Technical Implementation

### API Enhancements (`transactionApi.js`)

```javascript
// Updated API endpoints matching backend implementation
const subscriptionApi = {
  // Get packages (optionally filtered by business type)
  getPackages: async (businessType = null) => {
    const url = businessType 
      ? `${API_BASE_URL}/transactions/packages/?business_type=${businessType}`
      : `${API_BASE_URL}/transactions/packages/`;
    // Returns grouped packages by business type
  },
  
  // Get packages grouped by business type
  getPackagesByBusinessType: async () => {
    // Uses /transactions/packages/ endpoint
    // Returns: { data: { business_types: { MANUFACTURER: {...}, SERVICE_PROVIDER: {...} } } }
  },
  
  // Get feature usage statistics
  getFeatureUsage: async () => {
    // Uses /transactions/subscriptions/feature-usage/ endpoint
    // Returns: { data: { usage: { listings: {...}, featured_listings: {...} } } }
  }
};
```

### Feature Enforcement Utility (`featureEnforcement.js`)

```javascript
// Singleton utility for feature enforcement
import featureEnforcement from '../utils/featureEnforcement';

// Check if user can upload more products
const uploadCheck = await featureEnforcement.canUploadProduct();
if (!uploadCheck.canUpload) {
  // Show upgrade prompt
  featureEnforcement.showUpgradePrompt('max_listings', handleUpgrade);
}
```

### React Hooks (`useFeatureEnforcement.js`)

```javascript
// Easy-to-use React hooks for feature enforcement
import { useFeatureLimit, useFeatureAccess } from '../hooks/useFeatureEnforcement';

// Check specific feature limits
const { allowed, message, remaining } = useFeatureLimit('max_listings');

// Check boolean feature access
const { hasAccess } = useFeatureAccess('api_access');
```

   ```
   üéâ Complete Flexibility: Choose any package that fits your needs, 
   regardless of your business type!
   ```

4. **User selects any package they want**
   - No restrictions based on business type
   - Clear feature comparison
   - Yearly pricing display

### Feature Enforcement Flow

1. **User attempts to perform action** (e.g., upload product)

2. **System checks feature limits**
   ```javascript
   const check = await featureEnforcement.checkFeatureLimit('max_listings');
   ```

3. **If within limits**: Action proceeds normally

4. **If limit exceeded**: 
   - Action is blocked
   - Clear error message displayed
   - Upgrade prompt shown
   - Automatic navigation to subscription page

## üìä Feature Enforcement Examples

### Product Upload Limits
```javascript
// Service Provider Gold Package features
{
  "max_listings": {"value": "300", "description": "Maximum product listings"},
  "featured_listings": {"value": "15", "description": "Featured listings per month"},
  "storage_gb": {"value": "10", "description": "Storage space in GB"},
  "api_access": {"value": "true", "description": "API access enabled"},
  "custom_branding": {"value": "true", "description": "Custom branding options"}
}

// When user tries to upload 301st product
if (user.current_listings >= 300) {
  return "You've reached your limit of 300 products. Upgrade to get more listings."
}
```

### Featured Product Limits
```javascript
// When user tries to feature 16th product  
if (user.featured_products_count >= 15) {
  return "You've used all 15 featured listings. Upgrade for more."
}
```

### Storage Limits
```javascript
// When user tries to upload large files
if (user.storage_used_gb >= 10) {
  return "You've reached your 10GB storage limit. Upgrade for more space."
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Guide

### 1. **Adding Feature Enforcement to Components**

```javascript
import { useFeatureLimit } from '../hooks/useFeatureEnforcement';
import FeatureEnforcedButton from '../common/FeatureEnforcedButton';

function MyComponent() {
  const { allowed, message, remaining } = useFeatureLimit('max_listings');
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You have {remaining} product uploads remaining</p>
      
      <FeatureEnforcedButton
        featureName="max_listings"
        onClick={handleUpload}
        onUpgrade={handleUpgradePrompt}
      >
        Upload Product
      </FeatureEnforcedButton>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. **Manual Feature Checking**

```javascript
import featureEnforcement from '../utils/featureEnforcement';

async function handleAction() {
  const check = await featureEnforcement.canUploadProduct();
  
  if (!check.canUpload) {
    alert(check.message);
    // Navigate to upgrade page
    navigate('/dashboard/payment-platform?section=subscriptions');
    return;
  }
  
  // Proceed with action
  await performAction();
}
```

### 3. **Feature Access Validation**

```javascript
import { useFeatureAccess } from '../hooks/useFeatureEnforcement';

function ApiAccessComponent() {
  const { hasAccess, loading } = useFeatureAccess('api_access');
  
  if (loading) return <div>Checking access...</div>;
  
  if (!hasAccess) {
    return <div>API access not available. Please upgrade your subscription.</div>;
  }
  
  return <ApiInterface />;
}
```

```

## üéØ Tier-Based Package Selection

### **Two Selection Modes:**

#### **1. Browse by Tier (Recommended)**
- User selects tier first (Basic, Gold, Diamond, Platinum)
- System shows all business type packages for that tier
- Easy comparison across business types within same tier
- Perfect for users who know their budget/feature requirements

#### **2. Browse by Business Type**
- Traditional view grouped by business type
- Shows all tiers within each business type
- Good for users who want to see all options for their business

### **API Integration Examples:**

```javascript
// Get all packages grouped by tier
const tierData = await transactionApi.subscriptionApi.getPackagesByTier();
// Returns: { data: { tiers: { BASIC: {...}, GOLD: {...} }, available_tiers: [...] } }

// Get packages for specific tier
const basicPackages = await transactionApi.subscriptionApi.getPackagesForTier('BASIC');
// Returns: { data: { tier: "BASIC", business_types: { MANUFACTURER: {...} } } }

// Get packages with filtering
const filteredPackages = await transactionApi.subscriptionApi.getPackagesFiltered({
  tier: 'GOLD',
  business_type: 'MANUFACTURER'
});
```

### **Component Usage:**

```javascript
// Tier Selector Component
<TierSelector
  selectedTier={selectedTier}
  onTierSelect={handleTierSelect}
  availableTiers={availableTiers}
/>

// Tier Comparison Component
<TierComparison
  tier="BASIC"
  onSelectPackage={handlePackageSelect}
/>

// Full Tier-Based Subscription Section
<TierBasedSubscriptionSection />
```

## üìù Usage Examples

### Complete Product Upload Flow
```javascript
// 1. Check if user can upload
const uploadCheck = await featureEnforcement.canUploadProduct();

// 2. If not allowed, show upgrade prompt
if (!uploadCheck.canUpload) {
  showUpgradePrompt(uploadCheck.message);
  return;
}

// 3. Proceed with upload
const result = await uploadProduct(productData);

// 4. Refresh feature usage after successful upload
await featureEnforcement.refresh();
```

### Feature Usage Dashboard
```javascript
function FeatureUsageDashboard() {
  const { featureUsage, subscriptionSummary, loading } = useFeatureEnforcement();
  
  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  
  return (
    <div>
      {Object.entries(subscriptionSummary.features).map(([feature, limit]) => (
        <FeatureUsageCard
          key={feature}
          feature={feature}
          usage={featureUsage[feature] || 0}
          limit={limit.value}
          description={limit.description}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready subscription system with feature enforcement that scales with your business needs while providing maximum flexibility for users.
